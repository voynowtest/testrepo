Advanced Python Utility Library
===============================

Overview
--------
This repository contains an advanced Python utility library that demonstrates various programming concepts, including:
- Class-based Object-Oriented Programming
- Decorators for Logging and Retrying
- File Handling with JSON Serialization
- Mathematical Computations (Mean, Median, Standard Deviation)
- Randomized Fault Tolerance with Retries
- Basic Arithmetic Operations

Features
--------
- **Calculator**: Perform basic arithmetic operations (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) with automatic logging.
- **DataProcessor**: Filter, sort, and compute statistical properties of numerical data.
- **FileHandler**: Read and write JSON data to files.
- **RetryDecorator**: Automatically retry a function if it encounters an exception.
- **Logging System**: Logs function calls and results to `application.log`.

Installation
------------
No dependencies are required, as this project uses only the Python Standard Library. Simply clone the repository:
